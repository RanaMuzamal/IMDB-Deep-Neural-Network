An overview of Deep Learning, including representation learning, families of neural networks and their applications, a first look inside a deep neural network, and many code examples and concepts from TensorFlow. This talk is part of a ML speaker series at X we recorded at home. You can find all the links from this video below. I hope this was helpful, and I'm looking forward to seeing you when we can get back to doing events in person. Thanks everyone!
